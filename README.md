# ALX Listing App

## 📌 Project Overview
The **ALX Listing App** is the foundation of an Airbnb clone designed to showcase property listings.  
This project focuses on **scaffolding and initial setup** using **Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and responsiveness.  

The goal is to build a modern, production-ready codebase that supports clean UI design, reusable components, and optimized performance.

  - `common/Button.tsx`: Reusable button for actions like “Book Now” or “View Details.”  

 **`interfaces/`** → Stores TypeScript interfaces to enforce type safety.  
  - Example: `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`.  

**`constants/`** → Contains constant values and reusable configurations (e.g., API URLs, UI text).  

**`public/assets/`** → Stores images, icons, and other static assets used in the project.
